1
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,430
Abs, you ready?

2
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,474
Abby...

3
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,521
Abs.

4
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,402
Come on. I know you're in there.
Let's go.

5
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,238
Abby, come on.

6
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,532
Okay, okay.

7
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,826
You're being a jerk.

8
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,035
You know I have somewhere
I have to be.

9
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,578
Come on, let's go.
Five minutes.

10
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,831
I need you dressed.

11
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,919
Five minutes.

12
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,216
"And though
the dreamer remains asleep,

13
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,553
"he walks through memory
as if experiencing it

14
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,263
"for the first time anew,

15
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:32,809
no longer a passenger
but an active participant."

16
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,982
This stuff for real?

17
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,027
Some people think so.

18
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,446
Guess it depends on what you believe.

19
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,614
Summer of '82,

20
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,533
I traded a mint condition
Cal Ripken Jr. rookie

21
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,577
for a used copy of "Missile Command."

22
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,621
That card's probably worth
800 bucks now.

23
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,875
I wish I could participate
in that memory

24
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,419
and actively kick my own ass.

25
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,129
Can I keep it?

26
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,922
No.

27
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,591
I would like the walnut fudge,

28
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,176
but I want the fudge on the side

29
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,636
because I don't want it
to melt the ice cream.

30
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,513
And can I get some whipped cream on top

31
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,766
and three cherries?

32
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,809
Coming right up.

33
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:17,937
Hey.

34
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,481
You want your usual, right?

35
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,983
Uh, yeah.

36
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,487
So, when are you gonna bring
your sister by?

37
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,825
We got this new flavor,
Rainbow Explosion.

38
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,577
I bet she'll go crazy for it.

39
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,704
Mike?

40
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,586
Hey!

41
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,050
Hey!

42
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,177
Hey!

43
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,688
<i>Number 27?</i>

44
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,567
<i>Number 27?</i>

45
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,695
<i>Number 27?</i>

46
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,532
Follow me.

47
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,255
Mm.

48
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,513
What is your deal, Mike?

49
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,849
What are you, some kind of...

50
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,102
...head case?

51
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,230
You beat up a man in broad daylight.

52
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,483
In front of his child.

53
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,110
Daddy!

54
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,741
That was a mistake. Um...

55
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,325
It was a misunderstanding.
I-I thought...

56
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,536
Just look at your employment record.

57
00:08:56,578 --> 00:09:00,081
Tire Zone, sales associate,
two months, terminated.

58
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,875
Insubordination.

59
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,961
Media World, custodial staff,
one week.

60
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,213
It's like you're not even trying here,

61
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:12,093
yet you sit before me
asking for help.

62
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,305
I am just trying
to figure out who you are,

63
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,140
Mr. Michael Sh...

64
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,691
Hmm.

65
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,236
Coffee?

66
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,279
Sorry?

67
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,740
Uh, would you, would you
like some...

68
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,450
some coffee? I made some coffee.

69
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,993
No.

70
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,207
I'm-I'm gonna be brutally
honest with you here, Mike.

71
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,085
Given your track record,
your options...

72
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,587
are gonna be extremely limited.

73
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,340
- I'll take anything, okay? Any-any job you got.
- No. No.

74
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:54,803
Look, I-I-I get that part.
Um, it's just...

75
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,014
You know, it's not that easy.

76
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,560
Yeah. Thank you.

77
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,938
I have a job for you.

78
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,191
Come on, sit down.

79
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,736
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

80
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,949
Okay, uh, well, what is it?

81
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,952
It's a security gig.

82
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,788
Full disclosure. It's not great.

83
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,123
Right? High turnover.

84
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,708
That's what we call it
in the business,

85
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,127
but you get to be
your own boss. Sort of.

86
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,504
And you only have to worry
about one thing.

87
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,881
Keeping people out.

88
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,633
And-and, you know,
and keep the place tidy.

89
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,968
That's two things.

90
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,847
You want the job or not?

91
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,890
- How's the pay?
- Not great.

92
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,185
But the hours are worse.

93
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,647
<i> I can't do nights.</i>

94
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,733
Excuse me?

95
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,318
I can't do nights.

96
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,615
That's such a shame.

97
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,701
Yeah.

98
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,620
Thank you.

99
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,414
Wait, uh...

100
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,084
In case you have a change of heart.

101
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,657
Hey, Max.

102
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,369
Thanks for babysitting.

103
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,287
There's Stouffer's.

104
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,206
Should still be warm
if you're hungry.

105
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,916
<i>I have to tell
you, there is something magical</i>

106
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,251
<i>about these rings,
and you can have it within...</i>

107
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,921
I wish someone would
buy me a ring.

108
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,548
Did Abby eat?

109
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,841
What do you think?

110
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,387
Same time tomorrow?

111
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,013
Yep.

112
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,483
What do we got?

113
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,068
Okay.

114
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,737
Well, that good-looking guy
I recognize.

115
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,198
Who are all these other punks?

116
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,742
My friends. It's not done yet.

117
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,120
Well, look, you can finish up
after we eat, all right?

118
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,621
Come get some food.

119
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,831
I'm not hungry.

120
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,083
Abby, please, come eat.

121
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,587
- Come on. Here. Please come.
- No!

122
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,172
Come and...

123
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,512
Abs, with the day that I'm having,

124
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,931
can you just eat some food?

125
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,143
You're sitting on my friend.

126
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,523
You know what? I don't care.

127
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,358
Do whatever you want.

128
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,820
But you should know
what happens to little kids

129
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,196
who don't eat their dinners.

130
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,117
Their bodies stay
the same size forever.

131
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,910
And they never get to ride

132
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,496
the adult rides at the amusement park.

133
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,461
My friend says you're an idiot.

134
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,546
Mm.

135
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,548
At least I'm real.

136
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,654
How about some burger
with that ketchup, hon?

137
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,157
Everything's better swimming in ketchup.

138
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,035
Right, Mike? Whoop.

139
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,579
I'm gonna go grab a towel.

140
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,957
- Go watch your brother, okay?
- Okay.

141
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,918
Garrett.

142
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,728
Garrett?

143
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:13,038
Garrett! Garrett!

144
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,731
Just look at my nephew.

145
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,107
It's not even 10:00

146
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,734
and he-he can barely
keep his eyes open.

147
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:46,613
And this degenerate
is who they entrust

148
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,782
with the well-being
of a mentally ill child.

149
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,785
Jane, like I've said before,
Abby is not mentally ill.

150
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,328
Oh, right.

151
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,954
Perfectly normal to sit around
drawing pictures all day

152
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:59,292
and-and talking to magical
creatures who do not exist.

153
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,627
Listen, I think we all just need

154
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,879
- to calm...
- Don't tell me to calm down.

155
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,006
You're the doctor,
and you're making me feel like

156
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,675
I'm the crazy one?

157
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:12,639
And after... after what he did
to that poor man...

158
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:13,973
<i> I just...</i>

159
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:23,149
I have really tried to play nice.
I have.

160
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:26,695
But I have to think about Abby now.

161
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,488
Enough is enough. Doug?

162
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,783
Doug.
- Oh.

163
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,787
In your heart,

164
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,997
you know that this is
the right thing to do.

165
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,791
I hope that you will sign.

166
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,502
- And if I don't?
- Well, then,

167
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,462
my lawyer and I will
have to take you to court,

168
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,007
where any judge
with an ounce of sanity

169
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:51,302
will see to it that you never
see your sister again.

170
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,346
That what you want?

171
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,390
She-she doesn't even care
about Abby.

172
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,518
All she wants is the
monthly check from the state.

173
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,522
But, I mean, she-she has
some good points, though.

174
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,400
I'm hardly fit to be raising a kid.

175
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,861
I know a little girl
who would strongly disagree.

176
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,362
Come on.

177
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,197
She talks to air
more than she talks to me.

178
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,699
I could drop dead tomorrow,

179
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,784
and she'd be too busy drawing
to even notice.

180
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:19,205
You know, pictures hold
tremendous power for children.

181
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,207
Before we learn to speak,

182
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,710
images are the most important
tool we have

183
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,254
for understanding
the world around us.

184
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,424
What's real,
what matters to us most.

185
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,302
These are things
children learn to communicate

186
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,721
almost exclusively through pictures.

187
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,723
Yeah, her pictures mean something.

188
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:40,143
And who is at the center
of nine out of ten of them?

189
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,979
- Me.
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:46,566
Like it or not,
you're her world.

191
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,069
But what if it's not up to me?

192
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,737
My aunt, she's an idiot,
but she's right.

193
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,782
No judge in their right mind
is ever gonna side with me.

194
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,242
Did you find a job yet?

195
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,787
Okay.

196
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,956
That would be a good place to start.

197
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,346
<i>Hello.
- Uh, hi.</i>

198
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,264
Mr. Raglan, this is Mike.

199
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,935
- Mr. "I can't work nights."
- Right.

200
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,270
Uh, yeah, I was just calling
to see if that job

201
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,148
that you offered was, uh,
was still available.

202
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,150
Oh, it absolutely is.

203
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,944
Why? Have you had
a change of heart?

204
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,284
How soon could I start?

205
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,672
Let me give you
a little backstory.

206
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:54,509
This place was huge
in the '80s with the kids.

207
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,016
It's been shut down for years.

208
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,934
<i>The only reason
they haven't given it</i>

209
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,979
<i>the old wrecking ball treatment
is the owner's a bit of a...</i>

210
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:09,691
Well, he's kind of
a sentimental guy, I guess.

211
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,113
<i>Just can't bring himself
to let it go yet.</i>

212
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,867
Yeah.

213
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,413
Had some trouble with break-ins
over the years.

214
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:26,708
<i>Drunks and vagrants, mostly.
Not ideal.</i>

215
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,798
<i>Security system's dated
but fully functional.</i>

216
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,803
<i>Floodlights on the outside,
cameras inside and outside.</i>

217
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:43,058
<i>Fair warning:
the electricity is a bit...</i>

218
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,393
<i>iffy.</i>

219
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:08,458
Anything happens, there is
a breaker in the main office.

220
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,918
Just flip it.

221
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,936
Uh, I guess that's about it.

222
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,105
You know...

223
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,898
the rest is pretty easy.

224
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,568
Just keep your eyes
on the monitors and...

225
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,487
and keep people out.

226
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,406
<i>Piece of cake.</i>

227
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:10,729
So, I will catch you
on the flip side.

228
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,814
Hopefully.

229
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,839
The hell?

230
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,394
Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria,

231
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,022
a magical place for kids
and grown-ups alike,

232
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,484
where fantasy and fun
come to life.

233
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,695
If you're watching this video,
it means you've been selected

234
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,239
as Freddy's newest security guard.

235
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,908
Congratulations.

236
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,035
We're going to have
so much fun together.

237
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,831
The genius who created
Fazbear Entertainment

238
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,833
opened Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria

239
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,003
to indulge in
his two greatest passions...

240
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,672
family-friendly fun

241
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:21,549
and cutting-edge
animatronic technology.

242
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:24,260
- State-of-the-art robotic engineering

243
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,763
enables our characters
to interact with guests

244
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,765
in truly lifelike fashion,

245
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,726
while cleverly concealed
rechargeable lithium cells

246
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,896
give them limited range
to roam free.

247
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:38,983
Let's introduce you
to the stars of the show.

248
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:46,741
<i> Adorable, aren't they?</i>

249
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,035
Protecting these cuddly critters,

250
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,705
and the proprietary technology
that brings them to life,

251
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,456
is now your sacred duty.

252
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:57,877
Keep them safe, and help ensure
that Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria

253
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,714
is here to delight,
dazzle and entertain

254
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,716
<i>
for years to...</i>

255
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:07,846
All right.

256
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,272
Hello?

257
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,348
Everything's better
swimming in ketchup.

258
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,308
Right, Mike?

259
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,312
Go watch your brother, okay?

260
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,275
Garrett?

261
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,697
Garrett!

262
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,632
What is this?

263
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,345
Who are you?

264
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,138
That car.

265
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,808
Did you see that car?
You see what happened?

266
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,983
Did you see who took my brother?

267
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:51,820
Wait! No.

268
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,859
- Hey.
- Hey, Max.

269
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:39,951
So? How'd it go?

270
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:42,996
Uh...

271
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,290
it was interesting.

272
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,752
I should probably
get out of here.

273
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:53,840
Hey, by the way, I-I do intend
on-on paying you, eventually.

274
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,842
It's okay.

275
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,552
I know where you live.

276
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,411
Hey. Welcome to Sparky's.

277
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,622
Could I set you folks up
with some appetizers?

278
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,582
Yes.
Oh.

279
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,042
We are not eating.

280
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,752
Well, that's no fun.

281
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,087
You do realize that lunch

282
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,463
is the most important meal
of the day?

283
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:35,632
I thought it was breakfast.

284
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,217
Some people say that,

285
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,052
- but, you know, it's just a theory.
- Are you being paid

286
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:41,054
by the word,
or could we have a minute?

287
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,807
- All right.
- Thank you.

288
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:45,558
Ah, where were we?

289
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,143
Oh, you were about to tell me

290
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:48,311
what a miserable failure you are.

291
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,563
Hey, screw you, lady.

292
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:53,191
My sister went over every inch
of that dump a thousand times.

293
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,569
If there was something to find,
she would have found it.

294
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,029
Now pay up.

295
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,407
Uh, I'm sorry?
You said 200.

296
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,158
We had a deal.

297
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,244
Yeah, that you were gonna find me

298
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:07,038
hard proof of criminal endangerment.

299
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,041
Instead, you've told me
what a nice kid my niece is

300
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,043
and that my nephew sleeps a lot.

301
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,420
He really does, though.

302
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:16,631
Sleeping is not a crime.

303
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,216
Is that guy okay?

304
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:21,511
I just realized I shouldn't
be hearing any of this.

305
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:24,389
As a matter of fact,
I shouldn't be here at all.

306
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,890
Sit down, Doug.

307
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,601
So, I guess we're finished here,

308
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:31,229
unless either one of you
has a brilliant idea,

309
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,648
which I realize is highly unlikely.

310
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,567
Why don't we just kill him?

311
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,281
Tempting. But no.

312
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:44,617
- What else?
- Mike was saying that...

313
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:48,955
he really needs this new job
to, like, look good on paper

314
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,166
for the judge or something.

315
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,709
Well, that's all
very fascinating, honey,

316
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:54,961
but I am not hearing a plan.

317
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,505
We toss the place.

318
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,051
- Go on.
- Well, he's a security guard, right?

319
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,928
His job is to make sure
nobody gets in.

320
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,182
So, we get in,

321
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:09,142
and we mess up the place good.

322
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,603
We help ourselves to whatever
we find along the way.

323
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:13,480
Your nephew gets canned.

324
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:16,775
Judge gives you the kid,
and you give us...

325
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,361
$2,000.

326
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,113
One thousand.

327
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:26,034
But do it fast,
and don't mess it up.

328
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,535
I mean, you know, mess it up,

329
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:30,580
but don't...
don't mess this up.

330
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:40,131
<i>Come on. </i>

331
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:42,133
What are you doing?

332
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,430
Abby, do you need something?

333
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,140
- No.
- All right, quit playing and take that off.

334
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:50,308
I have to go to work.

335
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,018
I know. I'm coming with you.

336
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,186
No, you're not.

337
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,146
- Give me the vest.
- No.

338
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:57,899
Give me the vest now.

339
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,610
I'm coming with you.

340
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,779
I want to go with you.
Abby.

341
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:04,614
- I don't want to stay here with Max.
- Abby, stop.

342
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:05,439
- Hello?
- Abby, stop.

343
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:06,449
No! You can't make me.

344
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,826
Yes, I can.
- No, it's mine.

345
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,035
Hello?

346
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,829
<i>Let go! </i>

347
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,789
- Let go. No, no.
Abby, stop. Abby.

348
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:15,250
- He's taking my vest!
- Abby.

349
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,751
I'm keeping it.
- No.

350
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,840
She's all yours.

351
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:25,070
Garrett!

352
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,245
Wait, please.

353
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:37,582
Please don't-don't...
don't run.

354
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:40,710
Okay? I-I just want to know
what you saw.

355
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:48,468
Please. I'm begging you.

356
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,303
Help me.

357
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:56,601
Who took Garrett?!

00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:12,052
About time.

361
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:15,680
Starting to think maybe
you fell asleep on the job.

362
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:16,890
Um...

363
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:19,434
Can I, uh, help you, Officer?

364
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:22,103
Please, my name's Vanessa.

365
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:24,647
And you must be?

366
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:26,566
Um...

367
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:29,277
- The new security guard.
- Yeah.

368
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:33,198
You're bleeding, by the way.

369
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,536
Looks nasty.

370
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:42,165
Come on. I know where they keep
the first aid kit.

371
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:55,178
<i> Love what
you've done with the place.</i>

372
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,097
Why Nebraska?

373
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,684
- Oh, you need a hand?
- I'm fine.

374
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,977
You sure?

375
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:04,270
Here.

376
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:06,106
I'm a certified EMT.

377
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:09,693
So if your heart ever goes out,
I'm the one you want to call.

378
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:14,072
You seem to really know
your way around the place.

379
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:16,116
Well, Freddy's is on my beat.

380
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,493
I like to stay well informed.

381
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:23,331
Also, I really loved this place
as a kid.

382
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,169
There.

383
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,505
<i>That should do it. </i>

384
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:33,341
Vanessa Shelly.

385
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:35,593
Mike.

386
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:37,846
Pleasure to meet you, Mike.

387
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,855
You doing all right this evening, Mike?

388
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:49,649
What?

389
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:51,401
Are you good? Are you okay?

390
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:52,944
Is everything copacetic?

391
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:55,947
Yeah, I know what "all right" means.

392
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,532
Do you also know that your eyes
are bloodshot

393
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:58,950
and your heart rate's
through the roof?

394
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:01,327
And aside from that gash
on your arm,

395
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:02,996
<i>which...
let's be honest,</i>

396
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:06,124
is pretty frickin' bizarre,
you've been acting suspicious

397
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,876
since the moment you opened the door.

398
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:13,673
Yeah, look, it's been a weird night.

399
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:20,513
Sounds like Freddy's.

400
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,227
This place, it gets to people.

401
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:29,105
It's one of the reasons why
you're gonna quit.

402
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:30,857
I'm sorry?

403
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:31,983
Oh, yeah.

404
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,903
You security hires, you never last.

405
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:40,450
Have you met them yet?

406
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:43,453
Met who?

407
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,670
So, what are the other reasons?

408
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:52,754
Huh?

409
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,214
Why you think I'm gonna quit my job?

410
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,507
Well, you tell me.

411
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,550
Is this somewhere you see yourself

412
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:59,636
10, 20 years from now?

413
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:02,222
I mean, what do I know?
Maybe the benefits are great.

414
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,933
- I didn't think so.

415
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:07,936
Add to that the thing
with those kids going missing.

416
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,564
Wh-What did you just say?

417
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:14,109

some kids went missing?

429
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:14,586
Sure. Back in the '80s.

430
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:15,920
What happened to them?

431
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:18,298
It was big news.

432
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,508
That's why the place shut down.

433
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:22,677
Wow.

434
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,721
You really didn't do
your homework, did you?

435
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:29,017
And you're not even
wearing your badge.

436
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:32,562
Got it.

437
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:40,111
There.

438
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:42,655
Now you're official.

439
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,497
Hey.

440
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:51,831
Some friendly advice?

441
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:54,417
Don't let this place get to you.

442
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:57,045
Just do your job, and you'll be fine.

443
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,050
Yeah, sounds good.

444
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:27,033
<i>JEFF
It's showtime.</i>

445
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:30,662
As soon as he gets back,
get the guys and meet me here.

446
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:34,082
I think I see a way in.

447
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:49,472
All right.

448
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:51,725
Now, be quick but thorough.

449
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:54,102
Maximum damage, minimum time.

450
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:57,814
You see anything valuable,
grab it,

451
00:39:57,856 --> 00:39:59,899
and we'll, uh, settle up after.

452
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:01,735
- Good?
- Yeah. Golden.

453
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:03,570
Whoo!
- Yeah! 

454
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:05,113
- Let's go, boys!
- Come on!

Jeff!

00:42:43,563 --> 00:42:44,647

465
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:04,811

Carl?

469
00:45:27,644 --> 00:45:28,853
Hey.

470
00:45:28,895 --> 00:45:30,605
Follow me.

471
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,816
Hey!

472
00:45:32,857 --> 00:45:33,900
Hey, wait!

473
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:36,194
Come on.

474
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:40,782
Hello?

475
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,789
This way.

476
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:17,360
Warmer.

477
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:24,993
How in the heck?

478
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:32,000
Warmer.

479
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:06,659
<i>It's feeding
time for the giraffe.</i>

480
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:16,461
Hey, Abs, what you working on?

481
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:21,049
All right.

482
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:23,885
I guess you don't want this, then.

483
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:30,892
It's cool, huh?

484
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:38,066
<i> Okay.</i>

485
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,366
I'm trying my best, Abby, okay?

486
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:07,721
<i> Can't you read?</i>

487
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:10,265
You okay?

488
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:14,060
I made a mess.

489
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:15,687
I'm sorry.

490
00:48:16,604 --> 00:48:19,190
They're just...
they're just papers, all right?

491
00:48:19,232 --> 00:48:21,109
They don't...
they don't mean anything.

492
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:23,236
Then why do you have them?

493
00:48:23,278 --> 00:48:26,031
Well, that's complicated.
Aunt Jane...

494
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:27,407
I hate her.

495
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:29,743
She's mean and she smells
like cigarettes.

496
00:48:31,494 --> 00:48:32,996
It's not funny.

497
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:35,248
You're right, it's not.
It's just, uh...

498
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,875
I don't know, it's nice that

499
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:39,210
we can finally agree
about something.

500
00:48:39,252 --> 00:48:42,005
<i> Are you gonna
give me away?</i>

501
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:44,299
Abs, no, I...

502
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:50,472
Hey. Vanessa.

503
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:52,140
Hey, Mike.

504
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:54,017
And hello.

505
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:56,686
Vanessa, this is Abby.
Abby, Vanessa.

506
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:59,189
Hi, Abby.

507
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,649
Mike didn't tell me
he had a daughter.

508
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:03,568
- Gross.
- No, uh, Abby's my sister.

509
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,905
Ah. Well, he didn't tell me
he had a sister either.

510
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:09,449
Are you here to arrest Mike?

511
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,701
Okay, uh, can you
go play in your room

512
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:13,745
so me and Vanessa can talk?

513
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:15,163
It's nice to meet you.

514
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:20,126
What, um...
what are you doing here?

515
00:49:20,168 --> 00:49:22,962
- Somebody broke into Freddy's.
- What?

516
00:49:23,004 --> 00:49:24,881
Wh-What-what happened?

517
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:27,258
Recognize these?

518
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:30,345
Look, it's not
what you think, okay?

519
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:32,305
Th-Those are--
They're sleeping pills.

520
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:34,015
- They help me sleep.
- I know what they are, Mike.

521
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:35,350
It's written on the bottle.

522
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:38,645
News flash...
If you're too whacked out

523
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,188
to remember to lock
a friggin' door,

524
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:42,399
accident or not, you're liable.

525
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,234
It's called criminal negligence.

526
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:46,653
<i> You wouldn't understand.</i>

527
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:48,196
Well, then help me.

528
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:50,240
'Cause the moment I file that report,

529
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:53,034
it's out of my hands.

530
00:49:57,038 --> 00:49:59,374
You want to take a walk?

531
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:05,755
So I used to have a brother.

532
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:10,051
His name was Garrett.

533
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:13,847
<i> And when I was...</i>

534
00:50:13,888 --> 00:50:16,349
about 12,

535
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:18,768
he was, uh, he was taken.

536
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:22,480
And I was there when it happened.

537
00:50:24,315 --> 00:50:26,026
They never found the guy who did it,

538
00:50:26,067 --> 00:50:27,652
and they never found my brother.

539
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:36,995
So there's this theory that,
uh, we can't forget things.

540
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:39,998
Basically, it says that
every single thing that you see

541
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,792
in your entire life,
down to the tiniest of details,

542
00:50:42,834 --> 00:50:44,711
gets stored inside of you.

543
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:48,048
You just have to know how to look.

544
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:50,216
Your brother--

545
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:52,344
you think you saw who took him?

546
00:50:52,385 --> 00:50:54,346
I know I did.

547
00:50:54,387 --> 00:50:56,848
And I know that he's in here,
but he's just-- he's--

548
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,058
It's buried.

549
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:00,060
So every night, I dream,

550
00:51:00,101 --> 00:51:01,478
and I go back to that same memory,

551
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:03,730
and I-I search for details.

552
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:06,649
For any little thing
that got overlooked.

553
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:14,032
Yeah.

554
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:16,576
And that's usually the part
where people tell me I'm crazy.

555
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:20,789
I know what crazy looks like, Mike.

556
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,749
This isn't it.

557
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:24,793
Not even close.

558
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:28,338
And these?

559
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,715
I mean, going back to the same dream,

560
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:32,425
the same place night after night,

561
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:35,095
it's not easy,
so the-the pills help.

562
00:51:35,136 --> 00:51:36,346
Some other things,

563
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:38,264
like familiar sights,
familiar sounds.

564
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:39,933
"Pining for fun?"

565
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:43,895
"Visit Nebraska."

566
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:46,481
Your sister seems cool.

567
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:49,025
So it's just the two of you?

568
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:50,902
Yeah.

569
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:53,446
Yeah, it's just us.

570
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:56,616
Our mom died a little while back.

571
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:01,329
And Dad, he couldn't handle it,
so...

572
00:52:03,164 --> 00:52:04,582
You know what's crazy is, uh,

573
00:52:04,624 --> 00:52:06,626
when... when Garrett and I
were kids,

574
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:09,295
they were like
those perfect parents

575
00:52:09,337 --> 00:52:11,339
you'd see on old TV shows.

576
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:16,302
Yeah, ev-every night,
we would sit down together,

577
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:17,846
we'd have family dinner,

578
00:52:17,887 --> 00:52:20,640
and we'd hold hands
and say grace, and...

579
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,393
That actually sounds really nice.

580
00:52:23,435 --> 00:52:28,356
Yeah, at the time,
I thought it was really cheesy.

581
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:32,944
But then it's gone.

582
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:40,952
You and Abby,
you still have each other.

583
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:45,623
From where I sit,
I'd say you're lucky.

584
00:52:50,545 --> 00:52:52,839
<i> I should go.</i>

585
00:52:56,968 --> 00:52:59,471
No more sleeping on the job.

586
00:52:59,512 --> 00:53:02,349
When you're at Freddy's,
you stay alert.

587
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:07,020
<i>Hey, it's Max.</i>

588
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:10,148
<i>
Leave a message. Or don't.</i>

589
00:53:13,985 --> 00:53:16,237
Come on, Max. Come on.

590
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:20,241
<i>Hey, it's Max. Leave a mes...</i>

591
00:53:30,168 --> 00:53:31,670
I will work,

592
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:33,588
and you will sleep,
and under no circumstances

593
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:34,923
are you gonna come out
of my office.

594
00:53:34,964 --> 00:53:36,800
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

595
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:40,136
This is not a vacation, okay?
You're not here to have fun.

596
00:53:40,178 --> 00:53:41,721
Okay.

597
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:43,765
- Whoa, slow down, slow down, slow down.
- No, no, no.

598
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,933
Abby?

599
00:53:51,022 --> 00:53:52,941
Whoa.

600
00:53:52,982 --> 00:53:55,944
What happened?

601
00:53:58,196 --> 00:53:59,864
Give me your hand.

602
00:53:59,906 --> 00:54:01,116
Watch out.

603
00:54:03,034 --> 00:54:06,037
Do you want me
to turn the light off?

604
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:09,290
<i>Okay.</i>

605
00:54:09,332 --> 00:54:11,292
Good night.

606
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:14,462
It's like camping.

607
00:56:12,914 --> 00:56:14,749
Abby?

608
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:32,559
<i> I'll be right back.</i>

609
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:47,824
Hello?

610
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:55,457
I know you're back there.

611
00:56:55,498 --> 00:56:57,751
Might as well come out.

612
00:57:25,653 --> 00:57:27,906
You're those kids, right?

613
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,537
The ones who disappeared?

614
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:40,919
Look.

615
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:47,258
I don't know how it's possible
that you're here

616
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,678
like this in my dream, but...

617
00:57:52,389 --> 00:57:54,182
...I need your help.

618
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:56,059
Please.

619
00:57:57,727 --> 00:58:00,271
Help me remember
the man who took my brother.

620
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:07,320
If we show you,

621
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:09,197
what will you give us?

622
00:58:10,198 --> 00:58:11,950
Anything.

623
00:58:11,991 --> 00:58:14,202
I'll give you anything you want.

624
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,932
Abby?

625
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:41,646
Stop! Stop! Stop! 

626
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:43,231
Abby?

627
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:56,411
Mike.

628
00:58:58,163 --> 00:58:59,831
They wouldn't stop tickling me.

629
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:01,916
I thought I was gonna die.

630
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:05,712
Freddy, this is my brother, Mike.

631
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,717
- Abby, what is this?
Come on.

632
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:12,594
I want you to meet the others.

633
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:26,900
Mike, this is Bonnie,

634
00:59:26,941 --> 00:59:30,278
Foxy and Chica.

635
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,073
Everyone,

636
00:59:33,114 --> 00:59:34,199
this is Mike.

637
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,538
This-this is a joke, right?

638
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,916
I mean, th-there's someone here.

639
00:59:42,957 --> 00:59:45,710
There's probably somebody
controlling them, right?

640
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:47,170
I mean...

641
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:51,424
Okay, good joke!

642
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:53,510
Congratulations! You got me!

643
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:55,637
You can come out now!

644
00:59:58,306 --> 00:59:59,641
Hello?

645
01:00:05,772 --> 01:00:07,357
It's okay, Mike.

646
01:00:07,399 --> 01:00:09,275
They just want to play.

647
01:00:12,153 --> 01:00:14,906
- We have to go home now. Come on.
- Hold on.

648
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,121
They really like pictures.

649
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:36,970
I had a lot of fun tonight.

650
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:38,805
Thank you for playing with me.

651
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:42,100
Okay, okay, Abby, come on.

652
01:00:42,142 --> 01:00:43,977
Okay.

653
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:55,822
Bye!

654
01:01:17,093 --> 01:01:18,720
<i> There you go.</i>

655
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:55,757
It's them.

656
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,402
Hey, Abby, um,

657
01:02:15,443 --> 01:02:19,155
we need to talk about
last night, okay?

658
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:22,784
Um...

659
01:02:23,993 --> 01:02:26,913
So those, uh, those...
machines...

660
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:29,332
My friends?

661
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:32,335
Your friends?

662
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:34,421
Um...

663
01:02:34,462 --> 01:02:36,256
are they...?

664
01:02:36,297 --> 01:02:38,508
Ghosts?

665
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,136
- Yeah.
- Of course.

666
01:02:41,177 --> 01:02:44,055
How else could they make
the robots move?

667
01:02:46,516 --> 01:02:48,601
Right.

668
01:02:48,643 --> 01:02:50,311
Can I have some more soup?

669
01:02:52,022 --> 01:02:53,314
Yeah, sure.

670
01:02:57,861 --> 01:02:59,988
Hey, Abs.

671
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:03,450
You know we used to have
a brother, right?

672
01:03:04,659 --> 01:03:06,369
Garrett.

673
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:11,958
I don't... I don't really
talk about him very much.

674
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,544
Neither did Mom or Dad.

675
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:17,088
Yeah, it was hard for them.

676
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:20,008
It's hard for me, too.

677
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:35,148
C-Can you explain this to me?

678
01:03:36,524 --> 01:03:39,027
You-you drew that, right?

679
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:44,491
Okay, and... and-and
you know what that is?

680
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:48,953
Hey, hey, it's okay.

681
01:03:48,995 --> 01:03:50,497
Okay, I'm not, I'm not mad.

682
01:03:50,538 --> 01:03:52,165
I won't get angry at you.

683
01:03:52,207 --> 01:03:55,293
But I really need you
to help me understand, please.

684
01:03:57,837 --> 01:04:00,882
That's when Garrett got taken.

685
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:05,261
Abby, who told you about that?

686
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:09,557
W-Was it a-a boy
with blonde hair?

687
01:04:11,393 --> 01:04:14,896
Did that boy
ever tell you anything

688
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:17,482
about the man driving that car?

689
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:19,025
Anything at all?

690
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:21,444
Okay, just think,
think really hard, okay?

691
01:04:26,825 --> 01:04:28,118
No.

692
01:04:29,619 --> 01:04:32,539
All they talk about
is a yellow rabbit.

693
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,583
Okay.

694
01:04:36,918 --> 01:04:38,503
But...

695
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:40,046
I can ask.

696
01:04:41,464 --> 01:04:43,925
I would really appreciate that.

697
01:05:09,784 --> 01:05:13,246
♪ We love the yellow rabbit ♪

698
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:17,083
♪ We love the yellow rabbit ♪

699
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:27,844
Vanessa's here.

700
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:29,179
Yeah.

701
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,431
My friends talk about her sometimes.

702
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:34,309
- What do they say?
- That she's nice.

703
01:05:34,351 --> 01:05:36,978
Abby, if I asked you
to wait in the car, would you?

704
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,563
No.

705
01:05:39,522 --> 01:05:40,815
Abby, wait.

706
01:05:40,857 --> 01:05:42,317
Guys, I'm back.
- Abby.

707
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:45,111
- Hey, Vanessa.
Abby.

708
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:50,408
- Mike.
- Vanessa.

709
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:53,578
<i> I missed you guys.</i>

710
01:05:55,163 --> 01:05:56,998
You knew about this.

711
01:06:00,418 --> 01:06:01,711
Guess you figured it out.

712
01:06:01,753 --> 01:06:04,964
Ghost children possessing giant robots?

713
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:06,966
Thanks for the heads-up.

714
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:09,052
Guys, we need help.

715
01:06:12,347 --> 01:06:14,057
It needs to be big

716
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:16,351
so we can all fit inside.

717
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:22,857
Abby, look.

718
01:06:22,899 --> 01:06:25,318
Now, this is all really fun
and exciting,

719
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,529
but these things are big,
and they could be dangerous,

720
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:29,823
so I think we need to lay
some ground rules, all right?

721
01:06:29,864 --> 01:06:31,908
Vanessa, what do you think?

722
01:06:32,992 --> 01:06:36,329
I think we could use the tables
for the fort.

723
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:39,666

I like it in here.

01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:28,298
Me, too.

741
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:31,343
But I think it's gonna rain soon.

742
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:36,181
Sounds like we need a roof.

743
01:07:36,222 --> 01:07:38,391
I'll go see what I can find.

744
01:07:40,352 --> 01:07:42,645
I'll, uh...
I'll-I'll come with you.

01:07:43,938 --> 01:07:46,191
<i>Abby, don't forget to ask.</i>

746
01:07:46,232 --> 01:07:48,068
- Okay.
- Yeah.

747
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:52,072
What are you looking for, exactly?

748
01:07:52,113 --> 01:07:53,865
Tablecloths.

749
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:56,659
They used to keep 'em back here
for big events.

750
01:07:56,701 --> 01:07:59,746
Right. And remind me how
you know that.

751
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:04,125
Found 'em.

752
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:16,429
Don't.

753
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:18,264
I wouldn't do that.

754
01:08:18,306 --> 01:08:19,724
They're spring locks.

755
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:21,768
They're on all the older models.

756
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:23,687
They were designed
to keep the animatronic parts

757
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:27,649
in place so that, uh, a person
could safely wear the suit.

758
01:08:27,691 --> 01:08:30,694
They tend to be pretty unstable.

759
01:08:30,735 --> 01:08:31,820
Let's see.

760
01:08:33,154 --> 01:08:34,572
Ooh.

761
01:08:36,241 --> 01:08:39,327
Like I said, unstable.

762
01:08:42,288 --> 01:08:44,958
Is there anything else that you
want to tell me about, Vanessa?

763
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,086
'Cause you seem to know
everything about this place.

764
01:08:48,128 --> 01:08:49,170
And what if Abby'd come in here?

765
01:08:49,212 --> 01:08:50,630
What if she'd found that thing?

766
01:08:50,672 --> 01:08:53,466
You're the one who brought her,
Mike, not me.

767
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:56,511
What I can't wrap
my head around is why.

768
01:08:59,347 --> 01:09:01,516
All right, look.

769
01:09:01,558 --> 01:09:04,853
I think that they know
who took my little brother.

770
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:07,814
I can't explain it,
but when I'm here,

771
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:09,274
I feel closer to Garrett.

772
01:09:09,315 --> 01:09:10,817
My dreams are more vivid,
and it...

773
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:12,819
it's like I can almost...

774
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:14,863
Change what happened?

775
01:09:21,202 --> 01:09:23,038
Did you ask them about this?

776
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:24,456
Yeah, I tried.

777
01:09:24,497 --> 01:09:27,709
I don't think
they like me very much.

778
01:09:28,752 --> 01:09:30,211
But...

779
01:09:31,296 --> 01:09:33,673
...they do like Abby.

780
01:09:33,715 --> 01:09:37,010
Mike, you need to drop this.

781
01:09:37,052 --> 01:09:38,887
I don't really see how
that's any of your business.

782
01:09:38,928 --> 01:09:41,890
I'm telling you,
you need to let it go.

783
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:45,268
Who the hell are you?

784
01:09:46,436 --> 01:09:49,022
Just someone
who's trying to help.

Please.
Finding the guy that did this

795
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,086
is the only thing
that matters to me.

796
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:16,257
Abby?

797
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:18,677
Wait. Abby, don't!

798
01:10:25,558 --> 01:10:27,268
Abby?

799
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:30,313
Abby? Abby!

800
01:10:34,984 --> 01:10:38,113
- What happened?
It's okay, Abby.

801
01:10:38,154 --> 01:10:40,073
You just had an accident.

802
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:42,409
You're okay.

803
01:10:45,203 --> 01:10:47,330
I'm so sorry.

804
01:10:51,626 --> 01:10:54,421
I don't know what to say.

805
01:10:54,462 --> 01:10:57,048
Just go home, Mike.

806
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,633
Take care of your sister.

807
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:02,971
What are you so afraid of?

808
01:11:04,305 --> 01:11:06,683
In the storage room...

809
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:09,477
I saw your eyes.
You were terrified.

810
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:17,444
You can do whatever you want
with your own life,

811
01:11:17,485 --> 01:11:20,030
but if you ever bring Abby
back here again,

812
01:11:20,071 --> 01:11:22,323
I will shoot you.

813
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:34,127
She looked so angry.

814
01:11:34,169 --> 01:11:37,964
Why does everyone always
look at you that way?

815
01:11:57,692 --> 01:12:00,320
- Hey, it's Mike.

816
01:12:00,362 --> 01:12:02,322
I need your help.

817
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:15,960
Abby.

818
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,713
Is that bacon?

819
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:20,006
Hey, why don't you, uh, get dressed

820
01:12:20,048 --> 01:12:21,508
and then come to the kitchen, okay?

821
01:12:21,549 --> 01:12:22,967
I want to talk to you
about something.

822
01:12:23,009 --> 01:12:24,636
Okay.

823
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:33,061
Wow, there's my favorite
little girl.

824
01:12:34,604 --> 01:12:36,398
Come have a seat, all right?

825
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:38,858
What did you do?

826
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,652
Abby, look, I think
if you just sit down,

827
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:42,862
we can explain it to you, okay?

828
01:12:42,904 --> 01:12:44,197
No.

829
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,616
I promise you, this is not
what you think it is.

830
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:49,369
I hate you.

831
01:12:49,411 --> 01:12:51,579
I hate you, Mike!

832
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:57,836
Well, I-I think that went well.

833
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:12,684
She reminds me of you, you know.

834
01:13:12,726 --> 01:13:15,395
Always with the temper.

835
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:16,688
Well, look, when she calms down,

836
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:18,481
can you, um, tell her that I'm sorry

837
01:13:18,523 --> 01:13:21,151
and that I'll-I'll be back soon?

838
01:13:21,192 --> 01:13:25,196
Well, Mike,
there's a larger conversation

839
01:13:25,238 --> 01:13:27,115
that needs to happen here.

840
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:29,492
So when you do get back,
you and me are gonna have

841
01:13:29,534 --> 01:13:31,161
a little chat.

842
01:13:31,202 --> 01:13:33,121

A warm glass of milk

I tell you...

849
01:13:58,438 --> 01:14:00,648
What an asshole.

01:14:54,953 --> 01:14:57,080

Well, don't just stand there.
Dig in.

855
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:12,971
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

856
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:16,725
This... this isn't...

857
01:15:16,766 --> 01:15:19,019
this isn't how it happened.

858
01:15:20,061 --> 01:15:21,521
This isn't real.

859
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:23,023
But it could be.

860
01:15:24,315 --> 01:15:26,860
What is this?

861
01:15:26,901 --> 01:15:28,528
This isn't what I asked for.

862
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:30,822
But it's what you want.

863
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:34,367
No. I just, I just want
to find the man that...

864
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:35,702
You're lying.

865

That's why you're really here.

01:15:39,706 --> 01:15:42,167

868
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:43,626

869
01:15:43,668 --> 01:15:45,754
But I can't.

870
01:15:46,963 --> 01:15:48,590
He's gone. They're all gone.

871
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:50,759
Really?

872
01:15:58,808 --> 01:16:02,645
You can have this dream every night.

873
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,647
You can be together
with him again.

874
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:07,233

They love her, Mike,
and she loves them.

881
01:16:33,468 --> 01:16:36,179
You've seen how happy she is.

882
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:42,268
It's time to let her go, sweetheart.

883
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:46,147

Abby?

905
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:09,351
You can't stay in there
forever, you know.

906
01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:15,899
Suit yourself.

907
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,659
The pottery that grows.

908
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:28,078
<i>It's easy.</i>

909
01:20:28,119 --> 01:20:29,871
<i>Soak your Chia overnight,
spread the seeds...</i>

910
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:33,416
Oh.

911
01:20:48,598 --> 01:20:49,683
Freddy?

912
01:20:57,065 --> 01:20:59,526
Not Freddy.

913
01:21:01,111 --> 01:21:03,697
They're all waiting for you.

914
01:21:03,738 --> 01:21:05,323
It's time to go play.

915
01:21:12,872 --> 01:21:15,041
<i>Silly Aunt Jane.
</i>

916
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,584
She fell asleep.

917
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:20,714
How do we get there?

918
01:21:22,924 --> 01:21:24,676
<i>♪ I wanna be down ♪</i>

919
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:27,095
<i>♪ With what you're going through ♪</i>

920
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:29,889
<i>♪ I wanna be down... ♪</i>

921
01:21:29,931 --> 01:21:32,267
Where to, little lady?

922
01:21:34,811 --> 01:21:36,271
What the...?

923
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:38,606
Oh, my goodness!

924
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:44,279
<i>Not cool. </i>

925
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,032
Why do I always get the weirdos?

926
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:02,964
Careful.

927
01:22:03,006 --> 01:22:05,342
I managed to stop the bleeding,

928
01:22:05,383 --> 01:22:07,427
but you're probably
gonna need stitches.

929
01:22:07,469 --> 01:22:09,012
Where are we?

930
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:11,306
Police supply outpost.

931
01:22:11,348 --> 01:22:15,894
I found you,
and, uh, you were...

932
01:22:15,935 --> 01:22:17,562
you were badly hurt.

933
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:23,109
They tried to kill me, Vanessa.

934
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,156
But I'm guessing
you already knew that.

935
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:33,661
Max.

936
01:22:34,829 --> 01:22:36,289
Her brother.

937
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:38,833
You knew about them, too, right?

938
01:22:39,584 --> 01:22:42,045
- It's complicated.
- Yeah.

939
01:22:42,087 --> 01:22:43,880
<i> Yeah.</i>

940
01:22:43,922 --> 01:22:46,049
More complicated than

941
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:48,009
possessed robots
murdering innocent people?

942
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:49,969
They weren't innocent.

943
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:51,471
Yeah, Abby is!

944
01:22:52,305 --> 01:22:55,225
- Mike...
- You saw Abby playing with them.

945
01:22:55,266 --> 01:22:56,810
And you knew
what they were capable of,

946
01:22:56,851 --> 01:22:58,978
- and you didn't say anything!
- Mike, please just...

947
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:00,689
Abby is in danger!

948
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:03,358
Tell me what happened.

949
01:23:05,568 --> 01:23:07,404
In my dream...

950
01:23:08,905 --> 01:23:11,741
...they asked me for Abby.

951
01:23:11,783 --> 01:23:13,493
And I said yes.

952
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:18,123
It was a mistake,
and I-I tried to fix it, but...

953
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:22,669
What do they want
with my sister?

954
01:23:25,213 --> 01:23:28,633
They want to make her like them.

955
01:23:38,393 --> 01:23:40,729
Come on, let's go.

956
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:56,244
Where'd you go?

957
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:05,754
In the '80s,
when those kids went missing...

958
01:24:06,588 --> 01:24:08,381
...the police searched Freddy's
from top to bottom.

959
01:24:08,423 --> 01:24:11,760
Every inch was accounted for.

960
01:24:13,928 --> 01:24:16,264
<i>But they never found them.</i>

961
01:24:22,979 --> 01:24:24,731
Hello?

962
01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:30,904
The man who took them,

963
01:24:30,945 --> 01:24:32,781
<i>he was a...</i>

964
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:37,118
<i>He was a very bad man.</i>

965
01:24:37,911 --> 01:24:40,663
A very cruel man.

966
01:24:41,539 --> 01:24:44,376
Also a very clever man.

967
01:24:44,417 --> 01:24:46,252
<i>He knew that parents would cry,</i>

968
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:47,962
<i>and the police
would come looking.</i>

969
01:24:48,004 --> 01:24:49,798
<i>And he knew there's one place</i>

970
01:24:49,839 --> 01:24:52,550
they'd never think to check because...

971
01:24:54,344 --> 01:24:56,179
...why would they?

972
01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:01,643
<i>I mean, why would anyone?</i>

973
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:14,155
It's not just their ghosts that
are inside of those machines.

974
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,372
It's their bodies.

975
01:25:24,249 --> 01:25:27,293
You have to understand, the...

976
01:25:27,335 --> 01:25:30,130
the kids, they don't want
to hurt anyone.

977
01:25:30,171 --> 01:25:31,381
It's-it's him.

978
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:34,592
He influences them somehow.

979
01:25:34,634 --> 01:25:38,847
He took everything from them,
but they don't remember.

980
01:25:38,888 --> 01:25:41,391
Who, Vanessa?

981
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:44,227
I tried to warn you.

982
01:25:44,269 --> 01:25:47,355
I really did try in my own way.

983
01:25:48,273 --> 01:25:49,607
But it's too late now.

984
01:25:49,649 --> 01:25:51,901
He knows that
you're looking for him.

985
01:25:53,903 --> 01:25:56,072
He'll be coming.

986
01:25:56,114 --> 01:26:00,702
You need to tell me who he is.

987
01:26:08,209 --> 01:26:12,714
His name is William Afton.

988
01:26:15,383 --> 01:26:17,886
He's my father.

989
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:38,948
You knew?

990
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:40,367
<i> Mike...</i>

991
01:26:40,408 --> 01:26:42,202
This whole time.

992
01:26:42,243 --> 01:26:44,079
My brother, you knew.

993
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,206
Not about Garrett, no.

994
01:26:46,247 --> 01:26:48,875
A-At least...

995
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:50,418
not when we met.

996
01:26:54,964 --> 01:26:57,050
I'm so, so sorry.

997
01:26:57,092 --> 01:26:59,010
Tell me how to stop them.

998
01:26:59,052 --> 01:27:00,929
Tell me how to save my sister!

999
01:27:16,027 --> 01:27:18,947
Electricity.
Electricity is the key.

1000
01:27:20,115 --> 01:27:23,326
We use these for animal control.

1001
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,663
There's a Taser on your belt.

1002
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:28,748
It won't do permanent damage,

1003
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:31,251
but it'll mess with
the animatronic circuitry.

1004
01:27:31,292 --> 01:27:32,794
Hopefully buy you some time.

1005
01:27:34,295 --> 01:27:36,548
Come with me.

1006
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:39,092
No.

1007
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:42,804
Vanessa, you owe it to me,
and you owe it to them.

1008
01:27:42,846 --> 01:27:44,431
No, I can't.

1009
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:46,474
If he's there, I...

1010
01:27:47,475 --> 01:27:50,687
...I won't be any use to you,
believe me.

1011
01:27:52,981 --> 01:27:55,483
He really messed you up,
didn't he?

1012
01:28:00,947 --> 01:28:02,782
Take these.

1013
01:28:14,044 --> 01:28:16,629
You need to avoid
the front entrance.

1014
01:28:24,596 --> 01:28:25,972
<i>There's an outlet vent</i>

1015
01:28:26,014 --> 01:28:27,390
<i>on the east side of the building.</i>

1016
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:29,893

1018
01:28:46,368 --> 01:28:48,578

<i> Let go of me!</i>

1034
01:30:31,598 --> 01:30:32,557
Abby?!

1035
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:37,937
<i> Chica, let me go.</i>

1036
01:30:37,979 --> 01:30:39,731
Hey!

1037
01:30:42,692 --> 01:30:43,985
Leave her alone!

1038
01:30:55,288 --> 01:30:56,331
Mike.

1039
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:57,791
Hey.

1040
01:30:57,832 --> 01:30:59,125
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

1041
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:00,919
I don't know what's wrong with her.

1042
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,004
I don't know why she was
trying to hurt me.

1043
01:31:03,046 --> 01:31:05,173
I know. I know.

1044
01:31:05,215 --> 01:31:07,634
Hey, Abby, listen to me.

1045
01:31:07,676 --> 01:31:10,887
I've been an idiot
about so many things.

1046
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:13,139
I've been stuck
trying to fix the past,

1047
01:31:13,181 --> 01:31:15,934
but you are the most important
thing in the world to me,

1048
01:31:15,975 --> 01:31:17,644
and I promise you
I'm gonna do better.

1049
01:31:17,686 --> 01:31:19,562
I love you, too, Mike.

1050
01:31:19,604 --> 01:31:21,314
But we should probably go now.

1051
01:31:21,356 --> 01:31:22,857
Right, okay. Come on.

1052
01:31:41,292 --> 01:31:43,003
Mike!

1053
01:31:44,504 --> 01:31:46,506
Run! Hide! Abby, go!

1054
01:33:25,772 --> 01:33:27,607
Abby?

1055
01:33:27,649 --> 01:33:29,818
Abby, where are you?

1056
01:33:32,821 --> 01:33:34,114
Abby?

1057
01:34:36,593 --> 01:34:37,719
- Vanessa.
- It's okay.

1058
01:34:37,761 --> 01:34:39,054
Foxy.

1059
01:34:42,223 --> 01:34:43,641
I need to get you somewhere safe

1060
01:34:43,683 --> 01:34:45,894
so I can go help
your brother, okay?

1061
01:34:47,103 --> 01:34:50,440
<i> You couldn't just
leave it alone, could you?</i>

1062
01:34:50,482 --> 01:34:52,901
<i> Lucky me.</i>

1063
01:34:55,737 --> 01:34:56,946
This is perfect.

1064
01:34:56,988 --> 01:34:59,407
First I killed your brother.

1065
01:35:01,284 --> 01:35:03,036
Now I kill you.

1066
01:35:03,078 --> 01:35:05,455
Symmetry, my friend.

1067
01:35:05,497 --> 01:35:06,539
Go to hell.

1068
01:35:15,131 --> 01:35:18,093
Wake up, children.

1069
01:35:19,928 --> 01:35:23,056
I have something for you
to play with.

1070
01:35:27,102 --> 01:35:29,771
This is gonna be so much fun.

1071
01:35:32,482 --> 01:35:36,986
Little ones tell me
you have a sister.

1072
01:35:37,028 --> 01:35:38,947
She will love it here.

1073
01:35:40,615 --> 01:35:43,576
You, however, are finished.

1074
01:35:43,618 --> 01:35:46,496
Farewell, Michael Schmidt.

1075
01:35:46,538 --> 01:35:48,289
That's enough!

1076
01:35:49,457 --> 01:35:51,668
Drop the knife.

1077
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:55,922
A little old for temper tantrums,
aren't we, Vanessa?

1078
01:35:55,964 --> 01:35:58,466
I'm not kidding, Dad.

1079
01:36:06,224 --> 01:36:08,893
You may have forgotten your
loyalties, but I assure you,

1080
01:36:08,935 --> 01:36:11,187
they have not.

1081
01:36:12,814 --> 01:36:14,274
Mike!

1082
01:36:16,776 --> 01:36:18,695
Please wake up.

1083
01:36:18,737 --> 01:36:20,613
Now, put that thing away

1084
01:36:20,655 --> 01:36:24,451
and help me clean up the mess
that you created!

1085
01:36:24,492 --> 01:36:25,493
Please.

1086
01:36:25,535 --> 01:36:27,787
Please, Mike. Please. No!

1087
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:30,415
Come on.

1088
01:36:31,541 --> 01:36:33,793
We both know you're not gonna use a...

1089
01:36:42,052 --> 01:36:43,678
Mike. Mike.

1090
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:45,889
Abby. Abby.

1091
01:36:49,726 --> 01:36:53,063
The Yellow Rabbit,
he controls them.

1092
01:36:53,104 --> 01:36:55,523
The drawings.

1093
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:59,819
The Yellow Rabbit hurt your friends.

1094
01:36:59,861 --> 01:37:02,030
Show them what really happened.

1095
01:37:05,867 --> 01:37:08,411
You had one job.

1096
01:37:08,453 --> 01:37:09,788
One.

1097
01:37:09,829 --> 01:37:11,081
Keep him in the dark

1098
01:37:11,122 --> 01:37:13,500
and kill him
if he got too close.

1099
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:15,335
That's two jobs.

1100
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,694
- No!
- Let go!

1101
01:37:40,735 --> 01:37:42,445
I won't let you hurt her, too.

1102
01:37:48,326 --> 01:37:49,536
Dad.

1103
01:37:56,793 --> 01:37:58,128
Hey.

1104
01:37:59,004 --> 01:38:00,797
Hey.

1105
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:14,519
What have you done?

1106
01:38:44,132 --> 01:38:46,384
They can see you now.

1107
01:38:46,426 --> 01:38:48,595
They know what you did.

1108
01:38:49,763 --> 01:38:51,514
Move.

1109
01:38:51,556 --> 01:38:52,599
Move!

1110
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,983
Mike!

1111
01:39:07,072 --> 01:39:09,282
Look at you.

1112
01:39:09,324 --> 01:39:12,660
Look at the nasty things
that you have become.

1113
01:39:12,702 --> 01:39:15,580
Look how small you are,
how worthless you are.

1114
01:39:15,622 --> 01:39:18,166
You are wretched,
rotten little beasts.

1115
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:19,501
I made you!

1116
01:39:54,369 --> 01:39:56,371
I always come back.

1117
01:40:10,051 --> 01:40:11,219
What is happening?

1118
01:40:11,261 --> 01:40:13,179
The spring locks.

1119
01:40:22,355 --> 01:40:24,357
Okay. 

1120
01:40:28,069 --> 01:40:29,904
<i> Come on. Come on.</i>

1121
01:40:29,946 --> 01:40:32,115
Come on.

1122
01:41:04,606 --> 01:41:06,149
- Okay, one more.
- Oh, wait, one more?

1123
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:07,901
- Put one more? One more block?
- Yeah.

1124
01:41:07,942 --> 01:41:08,470
- One more block?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1125
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:10,070
Yeah. Yeah. Let's do one more.

1126
01:41:10,111 --> 01:41:11,488
It's really extraordinary,

1127
01:41:11,529 --> 01:41:14,324
the turn she's taken
these past few weeks.

1128
01:41:14,366 --> 01:41:17,619
Whatever you're doing,
keep doing it.

1129
01:41:19,746 --> 01:41:21,748
Yeah, I will.

1130
01:41:24,084 --> 01:41:25,293
It's not that hard.

1131
01:41:25,335 --> 01:41:27,253
What do you want for dinner?

1132
01:41:27,295 --> 01:41:29,506
Pizza or spaghetti?

1133
01:41:30,965 --> 01:41:32,467
Both.

1134
01:41:32,509 --> 01:41:35,595
You got to choose. Which is it?

1135
01:41:35,637 --> 01:41:36,805
But I want both.

1136
01:41:36,846 --> 01:41:39,140
You can't have both.

1137
01:41:40,392 --> 01:41:43,103
Spaghetti with meatballs.

1138
01:41:43,144 --> 01:41:45,313
All right, with meatballs.

1139
01:41:46,731 --> 01:41:49,109
Um, we're gonna make
a quick stop, okay?

1140
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:03,623
Vanessa, I don't know if...

1141
01:42:03,665 --> 01:42:06,793
you can hear any of this,
but, um...

1142
01:42:09,004 --> 01:42:11,631
...I'm having a hard time just

1143
01:42:11,673 --> 01:42:13,758
processing everything that happened.

1144
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:17,178
But you were there for me and Abby

1145
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:19,180
when it mattered the most.

1146
01:42:19,222 --> 01:42:21,891
And I don't think that either
of us would be here today

1147
01:42:21,933 --> 01:42:23,810
if it weren't for you.

1148
01:42:26,855 --> 01:42:28,606
So...

1149
01:42:31,151 --> 01:42:32,861
So get better.

1150
01:42:35,238 --> 01:42:37,574
And we'll be here
when you wake up.

1151
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:44,831
Did you tell her I said hi?

1152
01:42:44,873 --> 01:42:46,541
I did.

1153
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:49,586
All right, let's get out of here.

1154
01:42:53,506 --> 01:42:55,258
You okay?

1155
01:42:56,384 --> 01:42:57,844
I was just thinking

1156
01:42:57,886 --> 01:43:00,263
- about my friends.
Hmm.

1157
01:43:00,305 --> 01:43:01,973
They're all alone.

1158
01:43:03,224 --> 01:43:04,392
Right.

1159
01:43:04,434 --> 01:43:06,936
No one takes care of them anymore.

1160
01:43:08,396 --> 01:43:11,232
Can we visit them sometime?

1161
01:43:13,943 --> 01:43:15,737
Um...

1162
01:43:19,824 --> 01:43:22,285
You know what?

1163
01:43:22,327 --> 01:43:24,871
You never know what can happen.

1164
01:43:25,914 --> 01:43:28,291
Do you think if you drink
enough milk,

1165
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:30,585
you just turn into a cow?
- No.

1166
01:43:30,627 --> 01:43:32,545
Would you start, like,

1167
01:43:32,587 --> 01:43:34,631
getting, like, spots on you
like a cow?

1168
01:43:34,673 --> 01:43:37,092
No.
- What would happen? Just...
